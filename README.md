AEMBOT 2018 FRC Repository



The intent is to provide programmers with a sense of skill and comepetence for understanding the WPILIB.

As for complexity, I've selected initial classes based upon data from the WPILIB and other data from other FRC teams before kickoff. Among other things, we're looking at easy per-programmer learning rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to the code to ensure that programmers have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course achievable with the help of mentors.

I appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on LibertyRobotics, our discord and across numerous social media outlets.

I will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.
